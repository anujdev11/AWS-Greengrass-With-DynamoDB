# AWS-Greengrass-With-DynamoDB
Here I have implemented the Boto3 Module and GreenGrass SDK with python to send the Data from Raspberry Pi to Store Data in AWS DynamoDB

## 1.	Introduction: 
AWS IoT Greengrass is software that extends cloud capabilities to local devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions and store data on DynamoDB. So, for this blog we will store the local data to DynamoDB using Greengrass on local device.

## 2. Implementation Stepts
